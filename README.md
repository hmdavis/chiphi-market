chiphi-market
=============
simple marketplace to list items for sale:
http://chiphi-market.herokuapp.com/

### Run from local directory:
* Start mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ./data`
* Start web app: `node app.js`

### If I'm looking for more things to do:
* Implement basic search 
* Implement item deletion 
* Include authentication w/ passport.js
* Allow for multiple sub-marketplaces
* Refactor with some jQuery to make some things less hacky
